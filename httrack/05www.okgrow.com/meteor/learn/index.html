      <h2>What past students said</h2>
      <p>
        In an intimate and small setting, myself and other participants were able to
        have 1-on-1, hands-on coaching from Paul and his assistant Karl. This
        bootcamp has saved me the time I otherwise would have had to spend researching
        on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>- Apollo</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The sessions were highly interactive, explorative, and almost like daily work
        in a dev shop all the while learning about Meteor.  A great introduction to this
        emerging technology. +1
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>- Richard</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Paul and Karl were very knowledgeable and took the time to help those who
        needed it, while still maintaining a comfortable pace. I came away with a good
        understanding of the basics of Meteor and an enthusiasm to put it to use in my
        own projects.
      </p>

      <h2>Extras</h2>
      <p>
        We’ll make sure you’re well fed and caffeinated, provide some one-on-one
        followup, and we’ve even got an official Meteor t-shirt for you.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why learn Meteor?
      </h2>
      <p>
        So you want to learn how to build modern web apps. Today's minimum
        baseline is no longer pages generated on the server and forms with
        submit buttons. It's a browser-based JavaScript app. Backbone showed
        us what was possible and gave us a new way to look at web development.
        AngularJS and Ember took it to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
        But these frameworks are all missing an important part of a modern
        app: realtime data and live page updates. We now expect the page to
        update in response to new data, not just when we navigate or manually
        refresh the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can do this the painful way and waste your time: build an
        AngularJS app for the front-end, then build a back-end app in
        Rails or Node + Express, or whatever you like. Now hook them up with a
        JSON data API, add a websocket connection for real-time updates. Phew,
        this is sounding like a lot of work already.
        <a href='http://blog.fogcreek.com/the-trello-tech-stack/'>
          Here’s what the Trello team went through
        </a>
        back when there was no framework that could provide all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't like to waste time and effort.
        We always choose the tool that gets us the furthest with the least work.
        <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=26s'>
          The proverbial bicycle for the mind.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Meteor is a revolution just like Rails was 10 years ago - a huge leap
        in development efficiency. Meteor gives you a modern web app in a
        fraction of the time, and gives you live data and page updates for
        free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meteor builds on the best tools available:
        <ul>
          <li>Node.js, a proven back-end system</li>
          <li>MongoDB</li>
          <li>The websocket standard for realtime data</li>
          <li>And of course it’s pure JavaScript, seamlessly running on both the server and the client.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Meteor is a great open-source project with an all-star development team and
        <a href='https://www.meteor.com/blog/2012/07/25/meteors-new-112-million-development-budget'>
          a ton of funding
        </a>
        to keep improving. It's gathering huge momentum and we've jumped on for the ride.

      <h2>
        Why take a course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You can definitely learn on your own. But many people find that they
        learn faster and more deeply in a group learning environment. You'll
        be exposed to tools, ideas and best practices without needing to sort
        through outdated and incorrect information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus Meteor is still young, and there are a few gotchas that are
        valuable to know about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you been meaning to learn full-stack JS development for a while?
        Maybe now is the time. Draw a line in the sand.

        Why take a course from us?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We’ve been building web apps for a long time. We’ve used Rails since
        version 1, then Rails + jQuery, then Rails + AngularJS, and now we’re
        actually using Meteor for client work. We’re working with it every
        day.
