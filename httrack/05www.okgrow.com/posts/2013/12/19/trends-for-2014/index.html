      <p>The end of 2013 draws nigh! Here’s what we see happening in 2014 in web and
mobile app development:</p>

<h3>Trend 1: Android to overtake iOS</h3>

<p>Android will continue it’s rise as a mobile platform because of increased
market share and decreased fragmentation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/31/strategy-analytics-q3-2013-phone-share/">81%</a>
of mobile devices shipped in Q3 of 2013 were Android and in 2013 the proportion
of mobile developers using Android has risen to
<a href="http://www.developereconomics.com/report/q3-2013-state-of-mobile-developer-mindshare/">71%</a>.</p>

<p>iOS currently brings in more developer revenue, partly because it has larger
market share and partly because many Android phones are low-end, with outdated
OS versions because they were customized by the hardware maker or carrier and
don’t get updated.</p>

<p>But this is changing. Google is slowly winning battles to unify the fragmented
Android versions in two ways. First, there are now more &ldquo;stock&rdquo; Android
products at all price ranges, from the Moto G to Google’s Nexus line. And
secondly, Google has been <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/09/balky-carriers-and-slow-oems-step-aside-google-is-defragging-android/">moving functionality out of the core OS and into
Google Play
Services</a>
which is updatable independently of the core OS, so developers will care less
about the OS version. And Android is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/">becoming more of a Google-controlled
platform</a>.</p>

<p>The public launch of <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a> is
expected in 2014, which also boost Android and the Google platform.</p>

<h3>Trend 2: HTML5 to become the most popular mobile development platform</h3>

<p>HTML5 has matured as a mobile development platform. </p>

<p>Apple gave up attempts to ban third-party development tools long ago, and iOS 7
officially supports JavaScript as a mobile development language in Apple&#39;s
XCode tool chain. </p>

<p>But with iOS no longer the clearly dominant platform developers are looking to
expand their cross-platform options. In 2013 <a href="http://www.developereconomics.com/report/q3-2013-state-of-mobile-developer-mindshare/">HTML5 mobile came a close
third</a>
after Android and iOS and this is a growing segment.</p>

<p>PhoneGap, an open-source project backed by Adobe, continues to improve and is
the most popular option.  Hardware access from standard API’s is more widely
available and performance continues to improve (hardware-accelerated CSS
transitions look great even on 3-year-old hardware).</p>

<p>And Google Chrome continues to push the browser as a platform further on mobile
devices with features, performance, and amazing developer tools. </p>

<h3>Trend 3: The JavaScript application framework debate narrows</h3>

<p>In 2012 it was the Backbone, the contender, vs. at least a dozen upcoming
frameworks.</p>

<p>In 2013 AngularJS narrowly overtook Backbone as the most popular
application framework with the rest, including Ember.js in spite of it&#39;s very
vocal community, trailing far behind in popularity. <a href="http://dailyjs.com/2013/12/12/javascript-survey-results/">See the data
here</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of 2014 most developers will have made their choice.</p>

<p>We’ve been using AngularJS since mid-2012, but for 2014 the story takes a new
turn&hellip;</p>

<h3>Trend 4: Meteor is on the rise</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> application framework is maturing quickly.
With $11M investment by top VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, and a very impressive
full-time development <a href="https://www.meteor.com/about/people">team</a> it&#39;s one of
the most impressive projects we&#39;ve seen in a long time. It will reach version
1.0 in 2014, and is already hugely raising the bar for web applications.</p>

<p>It’s full-stack (both client- and server-side using Node.js) and provides
real-time UI updates with no extra effort, the killer feature.  We’ve found it
to be incredibly productive and easy to work with so far.</p>

<h3>What do you think?</h3>

<p>Let us know in the comments what you think. Have we missed something big? Are
we totally wrong? Set us straight or let us know what you think.</p>

<p>We&#39;re working with all of these things, and will take them further in 2014, so
